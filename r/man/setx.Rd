\title{Set Covariate Values for Counterfactual Scenarios}
\usage{
setx(object, ..., fn = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{zelig2} object produced by \code{\link{zelig2}}.}

\item{...}{Named covariate values. Scalars set a point scenario; a vector
creates a range scenario.}

\item{fn}{Optional character string naming a function (e.g., \code{"mean"})
to use as the default for unspecified numeric covariates.}
}
\value{
A new \code{zelig2} object with the scenario stored. Any previous
simulation results are cleared.
}
\description{
After fitting a model with \code{\link{zelig2}}, use \code{setx()} to
specify the covariate values at which quantities of interest will be
computed. Covariates not explicitly set default to their sample median
(numeric) or mode (factor / character).
}
\details{
For \strong{range scenarios}, pass a vector of values for one covariate
(e.g., \code{x1 = seq(0, 10, by = 1)}). All other covariates are held at
their defaults. Only one variable may vary at a time.

For models with \strong{fixed effects}, specify FE levels by name
(e.g., \code{state = "CA"}). Unspecified FE dimensions default to the
mean of their estimated intercepts.
}
\examples{
data(mtcars)
z <- zelig2(mpg ~ hp + wt, model = "ls", data = mtcars)

# Point scenario
z <- setx(z, hp = 150, wt = 3)

# Range scenario
z <- setx(z, hp = seq(50, 300, by = 50))

# Use mean instead of median as default
z <- setx(z, fn = "mean")

\code{\link{setx1}} for contrast (alternative) scenarios,
\code{\link{sim}} to simulate quantities of interest.
